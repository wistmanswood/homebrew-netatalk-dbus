# DBUS system bus for macOS
This is a patched version of the Homebrew dbus formula that installs a system-wide bus on macOS rather than a user session bus.

#### Quick how-to:

1. Install Homebrew:

    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

2. Install modified version of dbus:

    brew install wistmanswood/netatalk-dbus/dbus
